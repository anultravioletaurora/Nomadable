# Nomadable

<img src="logo.png" alt="Hashicorp Nomad Logo" width="200" height="225"  />

An Ansible playbook for deploying [Nomad](https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/docs) + [Consul](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs) across a mixed-OS cluster.

Nomadable is the parent playbook that composes the platform-specific child playbooks:

- **[Nomadintosh](https://github.com/anultravioletaurora/Nomadintosh)** — macOS (Apple Silicon) nodes managed via Homebrew and LaunchAgents
- **[Nomaduntu](https://github.com/anultravioletaurora/Nomaduntu)** — Ubuntu nodes managed via the HashiCorp apt repository and systemd

A single inventory can contain a mix of macOS and Ubuntu hosts. Nomadable dispatches to the correct child playbook based on the `ansible_os_family` fact of each host, so all nodes end up in the same Nomad/Consul datacenter regardless of operating system.

**[Nomad](https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/docs)** is a workload orchestrator by HashiCorp. It schedules and runs containerised and bare-metal applications across a cluster of machines.

**[Consul](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs)** is a service mesh and service discovery tool, also by HashiCorp. It provides a distributed key-value store, health checking, and DNS-based service discovery. Nomad integrates with Consul natively to handle cluster membership and service registration.

## Requirements

- Ansible installed on the control machine
- Child playbook repositories cloned alongside this one (or included as submodules)
- SSH access to all hosts in the inventory

## Inventory

Hosts are organised into named groups; the group name becomes the Consul/Nomad [**datacenter**](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/reference/agent/configuration-file/general#datacenter) for every host in that group. A single group may contain a mix of macOS and Ubuntu hosts.

Example inventory with mixed hosts:

```yaml
all:
  children:
    cosmonautical:
      hosts:
        mac1.example.com:
          server:
            enabled: true
        mac2.example.com: {}
        ubuntu1.example.com: {}
```

See the individual child playbook READMEs for the full list of supported host variables:
- [Nomadintosh inventory docs](https://github.com/anultravioletaurora/Nomadintosh/blob/main/inventory/README.md)
- [Nomaduntu inventory docs](https://github.com/anultravioletaurora/Nomaduntu)

## Running the playbook

Run a full deployment across all hosts:

```zsh
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.yml playbooks/nomadable.yml
```

To limit execution to a single host or group:

```zsh
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.yml playbooks/nomadable.yml --limit <hostname>
```

## What it does

Nomadable delegates to the appropriate child playbook for each host based on its OS:

- **macOS hosts** → [Nomadintosh](https://github.com/anultravioletaurora/Nomadintosh) — see that project's README for a full breakdown of what is configured.
- **Ubuntu hosts** → [Nomaduntu](https://github.com/anultravioletaurora/Nomaduntu) — see that project's README for a full breakdown of what is configured.

Both child playbooks configure Consul and Nomad with a shared datacenter derived from the inventory group name, so all nodes in a group join the same cluster regardless of OS.

## Remarks

- **Multi-platform clusters** — Nomad's native support for multiple platforms means macOS and Ubuntu nodes can participate in the same cluster and share workloads. Platform-specific capabilities (e.g. hardware acceleration on macOS, GPU passthrough on Linux) are exposed via Nomad node attributes and can be targeted with job constraints.
- **Child playbook versions** — Each child playbook is maintained independently. Pin submodule or collection versions as appropriate for your environment to avoid unexpected changes on deployment.
